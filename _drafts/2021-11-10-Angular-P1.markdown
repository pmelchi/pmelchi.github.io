## Angular versioning

AngularJS (Angular 1) - This is the initial version
Angular2 - it's a complete rewrite to fix Angular1 problems, since then versioning has changed and it now there's angular 12 relased on May 12, 2021


## Installing Angular

1. Download the current LTS version of angular in https://nodejs.org/en/download/
*Note.* it's easier if you install the MSI version, so you don't have to setup PATHS manually for the node or npm commands.
2. Install the latest version of Angular using the following command 
{% highlight shell %}
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
{% endhighlight %}

## Create a new project

To create a new project, we need to type from the command prompt.
*Note.* The project name cannot have any spaces or the word "test"

{% highlight shell %}
ng new <project name> --no-strict
{% endhighlight %}

The *--no-strict* flag is used to disable some optimizations along with best practices validation. This is to make our life easier in the begining of our development.

### Start the new server ###
We need to get into the folder and run ng serve

{% highlight shell %}
cd my-first-app
ng server
{% endhighlight %}
