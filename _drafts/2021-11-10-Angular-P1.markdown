## Angular versioning

AngularJS (Angular 1) - This is the initial version
Angular2 - it's a complete rewrite to fix Angular1 problems, since then versioning has changed and it now there's angular 12 relased on May 12, 2021


## Installing Angular

1. Download the current LTS version of angular in https://nodejs.org/en/download/
*Note.* it's easier if you install the MSI version, so you don't have to setup PATHS manually for the node or npm commands.
2. Install the latest version of Angular using the following command 
{% highlight shell %}
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
{% endhighlight %}



## Server side: Install DD client

The first step is to install ddclient in ubuntu, which you can achive by executing 

{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt-get install ddclient
{% endhighlight %}

This will take you to a series of steps to help you with the configuration, use the Google domain reference configuration.

- Note1. I usually confused about the server, it's domains.google.com
- Note2. Interface configuration will help you get the IP. So if you put your "eth0" you'll get your local IP. You might need to configure it to "use web", "use web" will use an external service to get your Internet IP.


## I need to change the configuration
if you missed something or typed something wrong, you can edit your configuration with

{% highlight shell %}
sudo nano /etc/ddclient.conf
{% endhighlight %}

## I need to test my configuration

You can run the following command to test your configuration 
{% highlight shell %}
sudo ddclient -daemon=0 -debug -verbose -noquiet
{% endhighlight %}
 
Where 
 - **daemon** Run the request right now
 - **debug** Print debugging information
 - **verbose** Print verbose information
 - **noquiet** Print messages for unnecesary updates

Here's the ddlclient official [usage information](https://sourceforge.net/p/ddclient/wiki/usage/)
