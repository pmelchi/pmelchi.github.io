I've adopted walking as one of my daily activities; it's one of those activities I can do if there's rain or shine, hot or cold weather. It helps me have a great conversation or listen to my latest podcast and re-focus when I cannot finish a task I'm struggling to complete. 
Although it doesn't replace a good workout, I would say that it has value as an activity that can be done in a workday at lunchtime or at any time during the day to pass that moment of "writer's block" while trying to design software or finish an important email.

# How Walking Can Boost Your Brain Health and Prevent Alzheimer's

Walking is not only good for your body, but also for your brain. A recent study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease Reports¹ showed that walking can improve brain connectivity and cognitive function in older adults with intact cognition and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

## TLDR

- The study involved 33 older adults (78.0 ±7.0 years; 16 MCI and 17 CN) who participated in a 12-week walking exercise training (ET) intervention.
- The researchers measured the within- and between-network functional connectivity (FC) of three core brain networks: the default mode network (DMN), the frontoparietal network (FPN), and the salience network (SAL).
- They also assessed the participants' cognitive performance using various tests of memory, language, and executive function.
- The results showed that ET increased the within-network FC of the DMN and the SAL, and the between-network FC of the DMN-FPN, DMN-SAL, and FPN-SAL.
- ET also improved the participants' cardiorespiratory fitness, verbal fluency, verbal memory, and narrative memory.
- Greater within-network FC of the SAL and between-network FC of the FPN-SAL were associated with enhanced narrative memory performance after ET.
- The researchers concluded that increased within- and between-network FC following ET may subserve cognitive improvement and resilience in older individuals with intact cognition and with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease.

## Why Walking Is Good for Your Brain

Walking is a simple and effective way to increase your physical activity and improve your health. But did you know that walking can also benefit your brain in many ways?

Walking can increase the blood flow to your brain, which provides oxygen and nutrients to the brain cells and removes waste products. This can help maintain the health and function of your brain and prevent age-related decline.

Walking can also stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections, especially in the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning. This can enhance your cognitive abilities and protect your brain from neurodegeneration.

Walking can also modulate the activity and connectivity of different brain networks, which are groups of brain regions that work together to perform specific functions. These networks are essential for complex cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, problem-solving, and creativity.

One of the most important brain networks is the default mode network (DMN), which is active when you are not engaged in a specific task, such as daydreaming, recalling the past, or imagining the future. The DMN is also involved in self-referential thinking, social cognition, and emotional regulation.

Another important brain network is the frontoparietal network (FPN), which is active when you are engaged in a specific task, such as planning, reasoning, decision-making, and working memory. The FPN is also involved in cognitive control, goal-directed behavior, and switching between tasks.

A third important brain network is the salience network (SAL), which is active when you are detecting and responding to relevant stimuli, such as pain, emotion, or novelty. The SAL is also involved in switching between the DMN and the FPN, depending on the demands of the situation.

These three networks are interconnected and interact with each other to support optimal cognitive performance. However, aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, can disrupt the activity and connectivity of these networks, leading to cognitive impairment and dementia.

## How Walking Can Improve Your Brain Connectivity and Cognition

The study by Won et al. (2023) investigated the effects of walking on the within- and between-network FC of the DMN, FPN, and SAL in older adults with intact cognition and MCI. The study also examined the association between the changes in FC and the changes in cognitive performance after ET.

The study found that ET increased the within-network FC of the DMN and the SAL, and the between-network FC of the DMN-FPN, DMN-SAL, and FPN-SAL. This suggests that walking can enhance the coherence and integration of these networks, which may reflect improved brain function and plasticity.

The study also found that ET improved the participants' cardiorespiratory fitness, verbal fluency, verbal memory, and narrative memory. This suggests that walking can boost the cognitive domains that are often affected by aging and Alzheimer's disease.

Moreover, the study found that greater within-network FC of the SAL and between-network FC of the FPN-SAL were associated with enhanced narrative memory performance after ET. This suggests that walking can strengthen the connectivity of the networks that are involved in processing and recalling complex and personally relevant information, which is crucial for everyday functioning and quality of life.

The study concluded that increased within- and between-network FC following ET may subserve cognitive improvement and resilience in older individuals with intact cognition and with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease.

## Conclusion

Walking is a simple and effective way to improve your brain health and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Walking can increase the blood flow to your brain, stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections, and modulate the activity and connectivity of different brain networks. Walking can also improve your cognitive performance, especially in the domains of memory, language, and executive function.
